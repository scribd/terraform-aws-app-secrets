# CODEOWNERS - Code ownership rules
#
# Ownership rules will be used automatically for suggesting reviewers on pull
# requests.
#
# Rules should follow the standard of a file matching pattern followed by a
# team name, e.g. @scribd/developer-tooling. Do not use broad teams, such as
# "Engineering", for code ownership.
#
# All lines starting with a `#` are comments and will be ignored.
#
# Order is important. The last matching pattern wins.

# Developer Tooling parent ownership
*    @scribd/developer-tooling
